# JavaScript Conditional Evaluation
Variable Initialization: var x = 50;
Expressions:
expression1: x < 25
expression2: x > 50
Conditional Logic:
Logs 'True True' if both expressions are true.
Logs 'True False' if only expression1 is true.
Logs 'False True' if only expression2 is true.
Logs 'False False' if neither expression is true.

* What is a switch case?
The switch statement evaluates an expression, matching the expression's value against a series of case clauses, and executes statements. (Ref. MDN)
